# Hello World

# Introduction - Practice Repository

I am a student at the University of Iowa with a major in Business Analytics and a minor in Environmental Planning and Policy. My anticipated graduation is May of 2021. I find interest in Business Analytics simply because of my fascination with the manipulation of data. Since a young age, I would take statistics of my favorite sports teams and analyze their performance as if it were a puzzle. The act of deciphering several different sets of data and then using that information to grow a business's efficiency is something that has always sparked my interest and dedication. My minor in Environmental Planning and Policy stems from a deep-rooted personal appeal and curiosity to nature and how to better the human impact on the environment. 

I have worked in many industries, ranging from food to corporate insurance, and have taken on many leadership positions. This exposure has supplied me with an understanding of the business world's inner workings. Along with that, my variety of experiences has also helped to mold my professional skills that I will continue to grow and apply as my career develops.
